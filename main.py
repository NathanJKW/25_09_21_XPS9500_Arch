Dotfiles / System Provisioning Entry Point
Version: 1.0.0

What the module does
--------------------
This is the main entry point for running all provisioning "modules" located
under the ./modules directory. It:

1) Starts a sudo keep-alive session (without keeping your password in memory).
2) Discovers and validates modules by their numeric order (e.g., 00_core, 10_foo).
3) Executes each module's `install(run)` function in ascending order.
4) Cleanly tears down the sudo session.

Behavior & Safety
-----------------
- Idempotent by design: individual modules are expected to use safe flags
  (e.g., pacman/yay `--needed`) and/or create backups before overwriting.
- Robust error handling: execution prints clear shell-like actions and
  returns a success/failure code (printed), without unhandled crashes.
